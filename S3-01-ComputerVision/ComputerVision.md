## CS1 – Computer Vision Fundamentals

---

## 1.1 What is Computer Vision?

---

### A. Definition

Computer Vision (CV) enables machines to **see**, **perceive**, and **understand** the world from images and videos — similar to human vision.

| Stage | Meaning | Example |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **See** | Capturing raw visual data using sensors/cameras | Camera captures a street photo |
| **Perceive** | Recognizing patterns, edges, colors, objects | Detecting cars, people, buildings |
| **Understand** | Deriving meaning or the "story" | Person crossing road, car waiting |

---

### B. Two Main Components (Imitating Human Vision)

Computer Vision mimics the two main stages of human vision:

**1. Image Formation (Seeing):**
- Mimics human sensory system — eyes capturing light
- Uses cameras, LiDAR, scanners as sensors
- Implements perspective projection similar to the eye's lens

**2. Machine Perception (Understanding):**
- Mimics human cognitive system — interpreting what is seen
- Uses algorithms for recognition, classification, and reasoning
- Employs hierarchical processing from features to semantics

---

### C. The Goal — Perceiving the "Story"

The ultimate goal of Computer Vision is to **reconstruct and understand the real-world story** behind visual data:

- Estimating 3D structure or shape of objects
- Recognizing objects and people
- Understanding actions and events within a scene
- Inferring relationships between entities

> **Key Takeaway:** Computer Vision attempts to move beyond pixels — to comprehend meaning and solve the inverse problem of reconstructing 3D understanding from 2D projections.

---

### D. Multi-Dimensional Visual Data

| Type | Dimensions | Examples |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **2D Images** | (x, y) | Everyday photos |
| **3D/Depth Data** | (x, y, depth) | LiDAR, stereo vision, Kinect |
| **4D/Temporal** | (x, y, t) | Video, motion detection |
| **Volumetric** | (x, y, z) | MRI, CT scans |
| **Multispectral** | (x, y, λ₁–λₙ) | Satellite imaging (few bands) |
| **Hyperspectral** | (x, y, λ₁...λₙ) | 100+ spectral bands for material identification |

**Understanding Hyperspectral Imaging:**
- **Definition:** Records a full spectrum of light at each pixel (visible, infrared, ultraviolet ranges)
- **Goal:** Identify materials based on their unique spectral signatures
- **Applications:** Agriculture (crop health), medicine (abnormal tissue detection), remote sensing (mineral exploration), material science
- **Key Insight:** While humans see ~3 bands (RGB), hyperspectral systems capture 100+ bands, enabling computers to see chemical and material properties invisible to human eyes

**Summary:**
- **Multi-dimensional visual data** captures information across spatial, temporal, or spectral dimensions
- **Hyperspectral images** enable computers to see beyond human capability by capturing full spectral signatures

## 1.2 Why Computer Vision is hard? (T1 Ch 1.2)

Vision is an **inherently ambiguous inverse problem** — many different 3D scenes can produce the same 2D image.

### A. The Inverse Problem

Computer vision faces a fundamental challenge: reconstructing 3D information from 2D images. This is inherently ill-posed because:
- Multiple 3D scenes can project to the same 2D image
- Depth information is lost during perspective projection
- All points along a projection ray collapse to a single pixel

**Example:** A small object close to the camera can produce the same image as a large object far away.

---

### B. Core Challenges

| Challenge | Description & Key Points | Example |
|-----------|-------------------------|---------|
| **1. Viewpoint Variation** | • Same object appears very different from different angles<br>• 3D pose changes alter visible surfaces and cause self-occlusion<br>• Requires **view-invariant features** | Car viewed from front looks completely different than from side or top view |
| **2. Illumination Variation** | • Lighting drastically alters brightness, contrast, and color<br>• Image intensity depends on: surface reflectance, orientation, light position, shadows<br>• **Intrinsic image decomposition** is ill-conditioned | White object in shadow may appear darker than black object in bright light |
| **3. Scale Variation** | • Object appearance changes significantly with distance<br>• Size in pixels varies inversely with distance<br>• Requires **scale invariance** for detection at varying sizes | Pedestrian detection: person 5m away (large) vs. 100m away (tiny) |
| **4. Intra-Class Variation** | • Objects from same class look drastically different<br>• Variations: shape, texture, color, design, articulation<br>• Models must generalize while maintaining discriminative power | Chairs: office chairs, dining chairs, bean bags, stools<br>Cars: sedans, SUVs, trucks, sports cars |
| **5. Occlusion and Clutter** | • **Occlusion:** Parts hidden by other objects or self-occlusion<br>• **Clutter:** Distracting background details<br>• Hides discriminative features, creates incomplete boundaries | Person in crowded street scene with multiple people overlapping |
| **6. Local vs. Global** | • Algorithms operate on local patches but need global context<br>• Combining local cues into coherent understanding is non-trivial<br>• **Binding problem:** which features belong to which object? | Yellow-black stripes: bee? tiger? caution tape? sports jersey? Context resolves ambiguity |
| **7. Noise and Errors** | • Real sensors introduce: thermal noise, shot noise, quantization errors, motion blur, compression artifacts<br>• Requires probabilistic methods: RANSAC, Bayesian inference, robust estimators | Camera sensor noise, JPEG compression artifacts |

---

### C. Summary of Challenges

| Challenge | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **1. 3D→2D Loss** | Perspective projection loses depth; all points along a ray collapse to one pixel | Small object nearby = large object far away |
| **2. Perception Ambiguity** | Same 2D image has multiple interpretations (optical illusions like Necker cube) | Machines face same ambiguity as humans |
| **3. Illumination & Shading** | Image intensity depends on: surface reflectance, orientation, light position, view direction, shadows | White object in shadow looks darker than black object in light |
| **4. Viewpoint Variation** | Same object looks different from different angles | Car front vs. side view |
| **5. Scale Variation** | Object appearance changes with distance | Pedestrian 5m away vs. 100m away |
| **6. Intra-Class Variation** | High diversity within same category | Office chair vs. bean bag vs. stool |
| **7. Occlusion** | Parts hidden by other objects or self-occlusion | Person in crowded scene |
| **8. Clutter** | Distracting background details create false positives | Busy street with overlapping objects |
| **9. Local vs. Global** | Algorithms operate on local patches but need global context | Yellow-black stripes: bee? tiger? tape? |
| **10. Noise & Errors** | Sensor noise, motion blur, compression artifacts | Requires probabilistic methods (RANSAC, Bayesian) |

**Key Insight:** These challenges require: multi-scale processing, invariant features, context integration, and robust statistical methods.

**Key Takeaway:** Computer Vision progresses through levels of abstraction:

**Low-Level Vision → Mid-Level Vision → High-Level Vision**

or equivalently,

**Pixels → Features → Meaning**

## 1.4 Image representation and image analysis tasks (T1 Ch 1.3)

For a computer to analyze or understand visual data, the information must be represented in a **digital, numerical format**. This digital representation allows algorithms to perform mathematical operations on images.

---

### A. Hierarchical Representation Levels

Computer vision processes images through hierarchical levels from raw data to symbolic descriptions:

| Level | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **1. Iconic Images** | Raw pixel arrays (0–255 intensity values) | Integer matrices, RGB channels |
| **2. Segmented Images** | Grouped regions, edges, corners, texture | Desk segmented into tabletop, laptop, mug regions |
| **3. Geometric** | Contours, boundaries, feature vectors | Shape descriptors, moments, curvature |
| **4. Relational/Symbolic** | Abstract object descriptions and relationships | "White mug on wooden desk, next to laptop" |

**Purpose:** Transform raw sensor data into increasingly abstract representations suitable for reasoning and interpretation.

---

### B. Pixels as the Foundation

Computers represent images as a **matrix (array)** of numerical values called **pixels** (*picture elements*):
- Each pixel corresponds to a small spatial region
- Pixel values indicate **intensity** (brightness) or **color information**
- Arranged in a regular grid

> **Key Insight:** A computer "sees" an image as a **grid of numbers** rather than objects or colors.

---

### C. Digital Image Definition

**Mathematical Definition:**
```
f(x, y) → intensity at coordinates (x, y)
```
where:
- x, y → spatial coordinates
- f(x, y) → brightness value

A digital image is a **sampled and quantized 2D signal**:
- **Sampled** → discrete positions (x, y)
- **Quantized** → finite intensity values (0–255 for 8-bit)

---

### D. Image Types

| Type | Channels | Value Range | Storage | Examples | Applications |
|------|----------|-------------|---------|----------|--------------|
| **Grayscale** | 1 channel | 0 (black) to 255 (white) | 1 byte/pixel | 100×100 image = 10,000 values | Medical imaging, document scanning, low-bandwidth transmission |
| **Color (RGB)** | 3 channels (Red, Green, Blue) | Each channel: 0–255 | 3 bytes/pixel | (255,0,0)=Red<br>(0,255,0)=Green<br>(0,0,255)=Blue<br>(255,255,255)=White<br>M×N image = 3 matrices | Photography, video, general computer vision |
| **HSV/HSL** | Hue, Saturation, Value/Lightness | H: 0-360°<br>S,V: 0-100% | 3 bytes/pixel | Separates color from brightness | Color-based segmentation, object tracking |
| **YCbCr** | Luma (Y), Chroma Blue, Chroma Red | Y: 16-235<br>Cb,Cr: 16-240 | 3 bytes/pixel | Y contains brightness information | Video compression (JPEG, MPEG), broadcast standards |
| **Lab** | Lightness, a (green-red), b (blue-yellow) | L: 0-100<br>a,b: -128 to 127 | 3 bytes/pixel | Perceptually uniform color space | Color correction, image editing, accurate color matching |
| **CMYK** | Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black | Each: 0-100% | 4 bytes/pixel | Subtractive color model | Printing, graphic design |

**Why Different Color Spaces?**
- **Illumination invariance:** Separate brightness from color (YCbCr, HSV)
- **Perceptual uniformity:** Equal distances = equal perceptual differences (Lab)
- **Compression efficiency:** Exploit human visual system (YCbCr)
- **Task-specific advantages:** Skin detection (YCbCr), color tracking (HSV), printing (CMYK)

### E. Image Analysis Tasks

| Task | Description | Key Algorithms |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **Measurement** | Quantify properties (intensity, contrast, dimensions) | Histograms, statistics |
| **Manipulation** | Preprocessing, enhancement | Filtering, transforms, morphology |
| **Recognition** | Identify objects/patterns | CNN, SIFT, template matching |
| **Navigation** | Localization, tracking | Kalman filters, SLAM, visual odometry |
| **3D Reconstruction** | Infer geometry from images | Stereo, SfM, MVS |
| **Segmentation** | Partition into regions | Graph cuts, FCN, Mask R-CNN |
| **Detection** | Localize and classify | YOLO, R-CNN, region proposals |
| **Tracking** | Follow across frames | Optical flow, correlation filters |

---

### F. Processing Paradigms

Effective vision systems combine multiple processing strategies:

| Paradigm | Flow/Approach | Advantages | Limitations | Example |
|----------|---------------|------------|-------------|---------|
| **1. Bottom-Up (Data-Driven)** | Pixels → Edges → Regions → Objects → Scene | • General purpose<br>• Discovers unexpected patterns<br>• No prior assumptions needed | • Sensitive to noise and clutter<br>• Computationally expensive<br>• May produce spurious interpretations | Edge detection → contour grouping → shape recognition |
| **2. Top-Down (Model-Based)** | Scene Model → Expected Objects → Predicted Features → Verification | • Efficient (guided search)<br>• Resolves ambiguity with priors<br>• Handles missing/occluded data | • Limited by model accuracy<br>• May miss unexpected objects<br>• Requires good initialization | Using 3D models to verify object hypotheses, template matching |
| **3. Cooperative (Hybrid)** | Detect features (bottom-up) → generate hypotheses → verify with models (top-down) → refine → iterate | • More robust than either alone<br>• Leverages strengths of both<br>• Handles complex real-world scenarios | • More complex to implement<br>• Requires careful integration | Modern deep learning: Feedforward (bottom-up) + Attention (top-down) + Recurrent refinement |

**Key Insight:** Practical systems integrate bottom-up feature extraction with top-down model-based guidance through iterative refinement loops.

### What Makes CV Work?
Hierarchical processing, multiple cues, prior knowledge, probabilistic reasoning, iterative refinement, deep learning

### Final Takeaway
Image understanding is a **hierarchical, iterative process** combining:
1. Multiple representation levels (Iconic → Segmented → Geometric → Symbolic)
2. Complementary tasks (Measurement, manipulation, recognition, reasoning)
3. Bidirectional processing (Bottom-up + top-down)
4. Integration of cues (Color, texture, shape, motion, depth, context)
