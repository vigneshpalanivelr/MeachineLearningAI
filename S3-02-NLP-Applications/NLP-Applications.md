## CS1 – NLP Applications Fundamentals

---

## 1.1 What is Natural Language Processing?

---

### A. Definition

Natural Language Processing (NLP) enables machines to **understand**, **interpret**, and **generate** human language — bridging the gap between human communication and computer understanding.

| Stage | Meaning | Example |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **Understand** | Parse and comprehend linguistic structure | Analyzing "Book me a flight" - identifying intent |
| **Interpret** | Extract meaning and context | Understanding "bank" as financial institution vs. river bank |
| **Generate** | Produce human-like language responses | Chatbot responding: "I've found 3 flights for you" |

---

### B. Core Components of NLP

NLP systems operate at multiple linguistic levels to process human language:

**1. Lexical Analysis (Word Level):**
- Tokenization — breaking text into words, sentences
- Morphological analysis — understanding word structure (stems, affixes)
- Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging — identifying nouns, verbs, adjectives

**2. Syntactic Analysis (Sentence Structure):**
- Parsing — analyzing grammatical structure
- Dependency parsing — understanding word relationships
- Constituency parsing — identifying phrase structure

**3. Semantic Analysis (Meaning):**
- Word sense disambiguation — resolving multiple meanings
- Named Entity Recognition (NER) — identifying people, places, organizations
- Semantic role labeling — understanding who did what to whom

**4. Pragmatic Analysis (Context & Intent):**
- Intent recognition — understanding user goals
- Context management — maintaining conversational state
- Sentiment analysis — detecting opinions and emotions

---

### C. Course Objectives and Scope

The NLP Applications course (AIMLCZG519) aims to provide knowledge on **designing and applying algorithms for real-life NLP Applications**.

**Key Objectives:**
- Demonstrate understanding of algorithms using different NLP tools
- Apply NLP techniques in state-of-the-art applications (MT, IE, NER, Relation Extraction)
- Provide overview of major NLP technologies with hands-on experience
- Sharpen programming skills for NLP applications
- Evaluate different approaches including **ethical considerations**

**Modern Technologies Covered:**
- Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Agentic AI and RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
- Deep Learning and Deep Reinforcement Learning
- Transformer architectures and attention mechanisms

---

### D. The Goal — Understanding and Generation

The ultimate goal of NLP is to enable **bidirectional communication** between humans and machines:

**Understanding (NLU - Natural Language Understanding):**
- Extracting meaning from human language
- Interpreting intent, entities, and relationships
- Building semantic representations

**Generation (NLG - Natural Language Generation):**
- Producing coherent, contextually appropriate text
- Translating between languages
- Summarizing and paraphrasing content

> **Key Takeaway:** NLP attempts to replicate human language capabilities in machines, requiring understanding of linguistics, statistics, machine learning, and domain knowledge.

## 1.2 Why NLP is Hard?

Natural Language Processing faces fundamental challenges stemming from the **inherent ambiguity, complexity, and variability** of human language.

---

### A. The Ambiguity Problem

Human language is inherently ambiguous at multiple levels, making computational interpretation challenging:

**Types of Ambiguity:**
- Multiple meanings can coexist without explicit disambiguation
- Context is often implied rather than stated
- Same expression can have different interpretations

**Example:** "I saw the man with the telescope"
- Did I use a telescope to see the man?
- Did I see a man who was holding a telescope?

---

### B. Core Challenges in NLP

| Challenge | Description & Key Points | Example |
|-----------|-------------------------|---------|
| **1. Lexical Ambiguity** | • **Polysemy:** Words with multiple related meanings<br>• **Homonymy:** Different words with same spelling/pronunciation<br>• Requires word sense disambiguation (WSD) | "bank" — financial institution vs. river bank<br>"bat" — animal vs. sports equipment<br>"book" — noun (reading material) vs. verb (reserve) |
| **2. Syntactic Ambiguity** | • Multiple valid parse trees for same sentence<br>• Prepositional phrase attachment problems<br>• Requires structural disambiguation | "She saw the man with the telescope"<br>"I shot an elephant in my pajamas" |
| **3. Semantic Ambiguity** | • Unclear referents and scope<br>• Quantifier scope ambiguity<br>• Metaphorical vs. literal interpretation | "Every child loves some toy" (different toy per child? or one specific toy?)<br>"He's a real tiger" (metaphor vs. literal) |
| **4. Contextual Errors** | • Spelling errors that are valid words in different contexts<br>• Grammar checkers miss contextual misuse<br>• Requires understanding beyond word-level | *your* vs. *you're*<br>*their* vs. *there* vs. *they're*<br>*affect* vs. *effect* |
| **5. Anaphora Resolution** | • Pronouns referring to previous entities<br>• Ambiguous references<br>• Requires tracking discourse entities | "John told Bill he was wrong" — who was wrong?<br>"The trophy doesn't fit in the suitcase because it's too big" — trophy or suitcase? |
| **6. Multilingual Complexity** | • 7000+ languages with different structures<br>• Low-resource languages lack training data<br>• **Code-switching:** mixing languages mid-sentence<br>• Dialect variations within same language | Structural divergence: English (SVO) vs. Hindi (SOV)<br>Hindi-English code-switching: "Main kal market jaaungi"<br>Regional dialects of Hindi, Arabic |
| **7. Cultural & Pragmatic Context** | • Idioms and expressions don't translate literally<br>• Sarcasm, humor, irony require cultural knowledge<br>• Tone and register variations | "It's raining cats and dogs"<br>Sarcasm: "Oh great, another meeting!" (negative despite positive word)<br>Formal vs. casual register |
| **8. Structural Divergence** | • Languages differ in word order, grammar rules<br>• Morphological complexity varies<br>• **Machine Translation** must handle these differences | English: Subject-Verb-Object<br>Hindi/Japanese: Subject-Object-Verb<br>German: compound words, case system<br>Arabic: right-to-left, root-based morphology |
| **9. Knowledge Requirements** | • Domain-specific terminology<br>• World knowledge needed for inference<br>• Common sense reasoning | Medical: "The patient presented with acute MI" (Myocardial Infarction)<br>Legal jargon, technical documentation<br>Inference: "The glass fell and broke" → glass is now broken |
| **10. Dynamic Language Evolution** | • New words, slang, abbreviations emerge constantly<br>• Social media language, emojis, memes<br>• Models become outdated | "LOL", "FOMO", "ghosting"<br>COVID-19 terminology (2020+)<br>Tech terms: "NFT", "metaverse", "prompt engineering" |

---

### C. Challenge-Specific Examples

**Polysemy in Context:**
```
"The bank raised interest rates" → Financial institution
"We sat by the river bank" → Riverside
"The plane needs to bank left" → Tilt/turn
```

**Word Sense Disambiguation Challenge:**
```
"He went to the bank to withdraw money"
Disambiguation: Financial sense (contextual cues: withdraw, money)
```

**Anaphora Resolution:**
```
"The city council denied the protesters a permit because they feared violence"
Question: Who feared violence? Council or protesters?
Resolution requires world knowledge and discourse tracking
```

**Code-Switching Example:**
```
Hindi-English: "Main office ja raha hoon, call you later"
Translation: "I'm going to office, call you later"
Challenge: Mixed grammar rules, entity recognition across languages
```

---

### D. Technical Challenges

| Challenge | Description | Impact |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| **Data Sparsity** | Limited training data for low-resource languages and rare phenomena | Poor model performance on underrepresented cases |
| **Computational Complexity** | Large vocabulary sizes, long-range dependencies | High memory and processing requirements |
| **Evaluation Difficulty** | Subjective nature of "correct" interpretation | No single gold standard for many tasks |
| **Real-world Noise** | Typos, grammatical errors, informal language | Models trained on clean data fail on real input |

---
