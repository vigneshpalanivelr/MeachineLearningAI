## CS1 – Computer Vision Fundamentals

---

## 1.1 What is Computer Vision?

---

### A. Definition

Computer Vision (CV) enables machines to **see**, **perceive**, and **understand** the world from images and videos — similar to human vision.

| Stage | Meaning | Example |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **See** | Capturing raw visual data using sensors/cameras | Camera captures a street photo |
| **Perceive** | Recognizing patterns, edges, colors, objects | Detecting cars, people, buildings |
| **Understand** | Deriving meaning or the "story" | Person crossing road, car waiting |

---

### B. Two Main Components (Imitating Human Vision)

Computer Vision mimics the two main stages of human vision:

**1. Image Formation (Seeing):**
- Mimics human sensory system — eyes capturing light
- Uses cameras, LiDAR, scanners as sensors
- Implements perspective projection similar to the eye's lens

**2. Machine Perception (Understanding):**
- Mimics human cognitive system — interpreting what is seen
- Uses algorithms for recognition, classification, and reasoning
- Employs hierarchical processing from features to semantics

---

### C. The Goal — Perceiving the "Story"

The ultimate goal of Computer Vision is to **reconstruct and understand the real-world story** behind visual data:

- Estimating 3D structure or shape of objects
- Recognizing objects and people
- Understanding actions and events within a scene
- Inferring relationships between entities

> **Key Takeaway:** Computer Vision attempts to move beyond pixels — to comprehend meaning and solve the inverse problem of reconstructing 3D understanding from 2D projections.

---

### D. Multi-Dimensional Visual Data

| Type | Dimensions | Examples |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **2D Images** | (x, y) | Everyday photos |
| **3D/Depth Data** | (x, y, depth) | LiDAR, stereo vision, Kinect |
| **4D/Temporal** | (x, y, t) | Video, motion detection |
| **Volumetric** | (x, y, z) | MRI, CT scans |
| **Multispectral** | (x, y, λ₁–λₙ) | Satellite imaging (few bands) |
| **Hyperspectral** | (x, y, λ₁...λₙ) | 100+ spectral bands for material identification |

**Understanding Hyperspectral Imaging:**
- **Definition:** Records a full spectrum of light at each pixel (visible, infrared, ultraviolet ranges)
- **Goal:** Identify materials based on their unique spectral signatures
- **Applications:** Agriculture (crop health), medicine (abnormal tissue detection), remote sensing (mineral exploration), material science
- **Key Insight:** While humans see ~3 bands (RGB), hyperspectral systems capture 100+ bands, enabling computers to see chemical and material properties invisible to human eyes

**Summary:**
- **Multi-dimensional visual data** captures information across spatial, temporal, or spectral dimensions
- **Hyperspectral images** enable computers to see beyond human capability by capturing full spectral signatures

## 1.2 Why Computer Vision is hard? (T1 Ch 1.2)

Vision is an **inherently ambiguous inverse problem** — many different 3D scenes can produce the same 2D image.

### A. The Inverse Problem

Computer vision faces a fundamental challenge: reconstructing 3D information from 2D images. This is inherently ill-posed because:
- Multiple 3D scenes can project to the same 2D image
- Depth information is lost during perspective projection
- All points along a projection ray collapse to a single pixel

**Example:** A small object close to the camera can produce the same image as a large object far away.

---

### B. Core Challenges

#### 1. Viewpoint Variation
- The same object can appear very different from different angles
- 3D pose changes alter visible surfaces and cause self-occlusion
- Algorithms must learn **view-invariant features** to recognize objects regardless of viewpoint

**Example:** A car viewed from the front looks completely different than from the side or top view.

---

#### 2. Illumination Variation
- Lighting conditions drastically alter brightness, contrast, and color appearance
- Image intensity depends on: surface reflectance, orientation, light position, shadows
- Systems must handle illumination changes to maintain consistent recognition
- **Intrinsic image decomposition** (separating reflectance from illumination) is ill-conditioned

**Example:** A white object in shadow may appear darker than a black object in bright light.

---

#### 3. Scale Variation
- Object appearance changes significantly with distance
- Size in pixels varies inversely with distance
- Detail level and texture visibility change at different scales
- Algorithms require **scale invariance** to detect objects at varying sizes

**Example:** Pedestrian detection must work for people 5 meters away (large) and 100 meters away (tiny).

---

#### 4. Intra-Class Variation
- Objects from the same class can look drastically different
- Variations include: shape, texture, color, design, articulation
- Models must generalize across appearance variations while maintaining discriminative power

**Examples:**
- Chairs: Office chairs, dining chairs, bean bags, stools
- Cars: Sedans, SUVs, trucks, sports cars, vintage models

---

#### 5. Occlusion and Clutter
- **Occlusion:** Object parts are hidden by other objects (partial occlusion) or by the object itself (self-occlusion)
- **Clutter:** Background contains irrelevant or overlapping details that create distractors
- Both hinder recognition by hiding discriminative features and creating incomplete boundaries

**Example:** Recognizing a person in a crowded street scene where multiple people overlap.

---

#### 6. Local vs. Global Understanding
- Algorithms often operate on local patches (keyhole view) but need global context
- Combining local cues into coherent global understanding is non-trivial
- The **binding problem**: which features belong to which object?

**Example:** A patch of yellow-black stripes could be a bee, tiger, caution tape, or sports jersey — context resolves ambiguity.

---

#### 7. Noise and Measurement Error
- Real sensors introduce: thermal noise, shot noise, quantization errors, motion blur, compression artifacts
- Requires probabilistic methods to manage uncertainty: RANSAC, Bayesian inference, robust estimators

---

### C. Summary of Challenges

| Challenge | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **1. 3D→2D Loss** | Perspective projection loses depth; all points along a ray collapse to one pixel | Small object nearby = large object far away |
| **2. Perception Ambiguity** | Same 2D image has multiple interpretations (optical illusions like Necker cube) | Machines face same ambiguity as humans |
| **3. Illumination & Shading** | Image intensity depends on: surface reflectance, orientation, light position, view direction, shadows | White object in shadow looks darker than black object in light |
| **4. Viewpoint Variation** | Same object looks different from different angles | Car front vs. side view |
| **5. Scale Variation** | Object appearance changes with distance | Pedestrian 5m away vs. 100m away |
| **6. Intra-Class Variation** | High diversity within same category | Office chair vs. bean bag vs. stool |
| **7. Occlusion** | Parts hidden by other objects or self-occlusion | Person in crowded scene |
| **8. Clutter** | Distracting background details create false positives | Busy street with overlapping objects |
| **9. Local vs. Global** | Algorithms operate on local patches but need global context | Yellow-black stripes: bee? tiger? tape? |
| **10. Noise & Errors** | Sensor noise, motion blur, compression artifacts | Requires probabilistic methods (RANSAC, Bayesian) |

**Key Insight:** These challenges require: multi-scale processing, invariant features, context integration, and robust statistical methods.

or equivalently,

**Pixels → Features → Meaning**

---

## 1.4 Image representation and image analysis tasks (T1 Ch 1.3)

For a computer to analyze or understand visual data, the information must be represented in a **digital, numerical format**. This digital representation allows algorithms to perform mathematical operations on images.

---

### A. Hierarchical Representation Levels

Computer vision processes images through hierarchical levels from raw data to symbolic descriptions:

| Level | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **1. Iconic Images** | Raw pixel arrays (0–255 intensity values) | Integer matrices, RGB channels |
| **2. Segmented Images** | Grouped regions, edges, corners, texture | Desk segmented into tabletop, laptop, mug regions |
| **3. Geometric** | Contours, boundaries, feature vectors | Shape descriptors, moments, curvature |
| **4. Relational/Symbolic** | Abstract object descriptions and relationships | "White mug on wooden desk, next to laptop" |

**Purpose:** Transform raw sensor data into increasingly abstract representations suitable for reasoning and interpretation.

---

### B. Pixels as the Foundation

Computers represent images as a **matrix (array)** of numerical values called **pixels** (*picture elements*):
- Each pixel corresponds to a small spatial region
- Pixel values indicate **intensity** (brightness) or **color information**
- Arranged in a regular grid

> **Key Insight:** A computer "sees" an image as a **grid of numbers** rather than objects or colors.

---

### C. Digital Image Definition

**Mathematical Definition:**
```
f(x, y) → intensity at coordinates (x, y)
```
where:
- x, y → spatial coordinates
- f(x, y) → brightness value

A digital image is a **sampled and quantized 2D signal**:
- **Sampled** → discrete positions (x, y)
- **Quantized** → finite intensity values (0–255 for 8-bit)

---

### D. Image Types

#### 1. Grayscale Images
- Single channel: 0 (black) to 255 (white)
- 100×100 image = 10,000 values
- Storage: 1 byte/pixel

#### 2. Color Images (RGB)
- Three channels: Red, Green, Blue (each 0–255)
- Examples: (255,0,0)=Red, (255,255,255)=White
- M×N color image = 3 matrices
- Storage: 3 bytes/pixel

#### 3. Alternative Color Spaces
- **HSV/HSL** — Hue, Saturation, Value (color-based segmentation)
- **YCbCr** — Luma + Chroma (video compression, JPEG)
- **Lab** — Perceptually uniform (color correction)
- **CMYK** — Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black (printing)

**Why Different Spaces?** Separate brightness from color, perceptual uniformity, compression efficiency, task-specific advantages.

---

### E. Image Analysis Tasks

| Task | Description | Key Algorithms |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **Measurement** | Quantify properties (intensity, contrast, dimensions) | Histograms, statistics |
| **Manipulation** | Preprocessing, enhancement | Filtering, transforms, morphology |
| **Recognition** | Identify objects/patterns | CNN, SIFT, template matching |
| **Navigation** | Localization, tracking | Kalman filters, SLAM, visual odometry |
| **3D Reconstruction** | Infer geometry from images | Stereo, SfM, MVS |
| **Segmentation** | Partition into regions | Graph cuts, FCN, Mask R-CNN |
| **Detection** | Localize and classify | YOLO, R-CNN, region proposals |
| **Tracking** | Follow across frames | Optical flow, correlation filters |

---

### F. Processing Paradigms

Effective vision systems combine multiple processing strategies:

**1. Bottom-Up (Data-Driven)**
- **Flow:** Pixels → Edges → Regions → Objects → Scene
- **Advantage:** General purpose, discovers unexpected patterns
- **Limitation:** Sensitive to noise, computationally expensive
- **Example:** Edge detection → contour grouping → shape recognition

**2. Top-Down (Model-Based)**
- **Flow:** Scene Model → Expected Objects → Predicted Features → Verification
- **Advantage:** Efficient, resolves ambiguity with priors
- **Limitation:** Limited by model accuracy, may miss unexpected objects
- **Example:** Using 3D models to verify object hypotheses

**3. Cooperative (Hybrid)**
- **Approach:** Combines both: detect features (bottom-up) → generate hypotheses → verify with models (top-down) → refine → iterate
- **Modern deep learning:** Feedforward (bottom-up) + Attention (top-down) + Recurrent refinement
- **Advantage:** More robust than either approach alone

---

```

### Key Insights
- **Hierarchical:** Pixels → Features → Meaning
- **Multi-Modal:** Color, texture, shape, motion, depth, context

### What Makes CV Work?
Hierarchical processing, multiple cues, prior knowledge, probabilistic reasoning, iterative refinement, deep learning

### Final Takeaway
Image understanding is a **hierarchical, iterative process** combining:
1. Multiple representation levels (Iconic → Segmented → Geometric → Symbolic)
2. Complementary tasks (Measurement, manipulation, recognition, reasoning)
3. Bidirectional processing (Bottom-up + top-down)
4. Integration of cues (Color, texture, shape, motion, depth, context)
